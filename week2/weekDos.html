            <p class="wikiParagraph"> Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form 
                the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach 
                to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, 
                expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the 
                acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to, 
                information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of 
                automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of
                 computation and the design of computational systems.

                    <h3>Passion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Computer science to my opinion is art. As a developer you have the 
                        power to created your own world; show the people what is in your thoughts 
                        through code. I concider passion to be important because having this ability to show 
                        this art, is not easy -It requires work... But the passion is what  
                        motivates you push throught the though times and continue

                        <h3>Persistency</h3>
                        <p>
                            As you continue developing and creating stuff from your computer, there will be many issues and uncertainties. 
                            They will drive you crazy, but the key is to keep trying and keep trying. In other words be persistance.  
                            </p>

                        <h3>Commitment</h3>
                        <p>
                                As you are creating the genius idea in your head... you will start to discover that it is not 
                                turning how you spected it to turn. It might look so different that you will consider deleting everything
                                and restarting... or even quitting. WELL DON'T. You have already commited -Continue that code until 
                                you understand what went wrong! By quitting all the time invested will be lost since you didnt truly 
                                learn were you went wrong... thus commitment in important

                    <h3>Creativity</h3>
                    <p>
                            Coding is like writting literature. Everyone has their own style of writting and there are 
                            more than one solution to every problem. So thinking outside the box, and be creative on how you 
                            want to writting to do.

                        <h3>Eagerness to learn</h3>
                        <p>
                            technology is advancing so fast; every day there are newer programming languages and more complex algorithms.
                            Surviving in this industry requires you to enjoy learning and updating to the changes in technology.

                        <p>
                            Well... this is self explonatory. After a stressfull time coding, a nice beer always helps 
                            relax the brain.

            <span class="span-3"> The beautiful part about being a developer is the online community. 
                Everyone wants to help each other, and people enjoy sharing their solutions to 
                issues they faced.
