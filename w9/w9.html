        <p> 
            The Game is intiative, very simple, but hard to undertand what the main purpose is. I guess 
            the tittle name "Everyday is the same Dream" does really make sinces.

        <h4>Game Graphics</h4>
        <p> 
            The graphics are good. They have a simple design, and its consistant throught the game.
            <br> 
            The graphic are very relevant to the story. As you play more and more you start to notice
            <br> 
            the purpose of the game, is about a man, whos life is boring and its the same everyday.  
            <br> 
            sort of a sad story. The graphics are greyish giving that perfect fit.

        <h4>Some game play: </h4>
        <p> 
                The game start out simple, I woke up. And as I would do in real life, I turn the alarm off.
            <br> 
                Decided to avoid putting clothes to see what you happen
                <br>    
                My wife wasn't very impress with me. 
                <br>    
                Continue down the road, and got in the elevator 
                <br>    
                One out! Took a left turn
                <br>    
                Waited until the light would become red ... but turns out I won't change, and I can't cross. Thus turn around and walked back...
                <br>    
                ..some how I ended up driving!! So I continue until the end
                <br>    
                My boss was angry I wasn't wearing clothing... and he fire me....
                <br>    
                Next time, I dress and went straight to work!.. This time I didn't get fire.. and continue to my work
                <br>     
                The cubicle never end.. until I reach .. the end and I jumped 
                <br>    
                On the next life! I notice the woman Keep saying in so many steps I will be a new man... decided to live more times until that number was zero. 
                <br>    
                ... I keep dying and dying and the woman in the elevator did not reduce the number...
                <br>   
                I got bored after 15 mins of playing, and decided to quit the game.
