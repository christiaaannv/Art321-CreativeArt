                You are to sketch the design of a net art work that makes
                use of some measurement of data being sent across an 
                Internet communication link. You could, for example, make use
                of how many characters were being sent, how many 0's were
                sent, or even aspects involving the destination address or 
                sender.
                <br> <br> 
                You do NOT need to implement this piece.
                <br> <br> 
                You need to explain what measurments/values will be needed, 
                how they will be used in the piece, and what other
                assets will be used.
                <br> <br> 
                You do need to sketch the work visually, and show transiations
                and explain visually how the data will be used.

                    <p class="p1"> The Idea is to have a phone line connected with the Net piece. The piece will have its 
                            own phone number, that way individuals coming to see the art can text the piece.

                            As people enter the location of the art, they can send a message to the balloon. Individuals are allowed to send anything
                            and it will be anonymous. Once the message is received, it will be display play in the balloon.

                            Of course, balloons can only grow so much. After the 
                            balloon has received so much Air(text), it will reach 
                            its maximum growth capacity causing it to...

                            balloon will appear. Restarting again.
